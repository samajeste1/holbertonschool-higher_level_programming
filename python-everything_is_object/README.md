# Python - Everything is object

This project explores how Python handles objects, references, and memory management.

## Learning Objectives

- What is an object
- Difference between a class and an object/instance
- Difference between immutable and mutable objects
- What is a reference, assignment, and alias
- How to check if two variables are identical or linked to the same object
- How to display variable identifier (memory address)
- Built-in mutable types: list, dict, set
- Built-in immutable types: int, float, str, tuple, bool
- How Python passes variables to functions

## Key Concepts

### Mutable vs Immutable

- **Immutable**: int, float, str, tuple, bool - cannot be changed after creation
- **Mutable**: list, dict, set - can be modified in place

### Identity vs Equality

- `==` checks if values are equal
- `is` checks if objects are the same (same memory address)

## Tasks
